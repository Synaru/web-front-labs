        <h1>HTML</h1>

        <h2>Basics</h2>

        <p class="p1">
            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
            It provides the structure and content of a website, while CSS handles the styling
            and JavaScript adds interactivity.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist.
            He developed HTML in 1989 while working at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory in Switzerland.
        </p>
        <p class="p3">
            Tim Berners-Lee created HTML as part of his vision for an information management system that would allow
            researchers to share documents easily over the internet. At the time, he was trying to solve the problem
            of how scientists could access and share research papers across different computer systems.
            Berners-Lee wrote a proposal outlining his ideas for this new system, which he called the "WorldWideWeb"
            project.
            This proposal included the concept of using hypertext links to connect documents, as well as a markup
            language to
            format these documents.
        </p>
        <p class="p4">
            The first version of HTML, known as HTML 1.0, was released in 1993. It consisted of about 20 tags
            and was designed to be simple enough for anyone to learn quickly.
            In the early days of HTML development, Berners-Lee worked closely with Robert Cailliau, another researcher
            at CERN.
            Together, they refined the language and its implementation.The first version of HTML, known as HTML 1.0, was
            released in 1993.
            It consisted of about 20 tags and was designed to be simple enough for anyone to learn quickly.
        </p>
        <p class="p5">
            Tim Berners-Lee's invention of HTML revolutionized the way people communicate and access information online.
            It provided a standardized way to create web pages, enabling the rapid growth of the World Wide Web.

            Today, HTML remains one of the fundamental technologies of the web, alongside CSS and JavaScript. Its
            simplicity and versatility have made it accessible to millions of web developers around the world.
        </p>
        <p class="p6">
            As a testament to its importance, the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), founded by Berners-Lee himself,
            continues to oversee the development and standardization of HTML to ensure its continued relevance in modern
            web development.As a testament to its importance, the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), founded by

        </p>

        <h2>Css</h2>
        <p class="p7">
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was developed by Håkon Wium Lie, a Norwegian computer scientist and web
            pioneer. He is often credited as the inventor of CSS. Håkon Wium Lie began working on CSS in 1994 while he
            was at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory where Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. At
            that time, HTML was becoming increasingly popular, but it lacked a standardized way to control the layout
            and visual styling of web pages.

            Wium Lie recognized the need for a separate language that could handle presentation aspects independently of
            content structure. This led him to propose the concept of Cascading Style Sheets.

            The invention of CSS revolutionized web development by:

            • Separating content from presentation, making websites more maintainable and accessible • Enabling
            consistent styling across entire websites • Providing a powerful tool for creating visually appealing and
            responsive designs

            After developing CSS, Wium Lie continued to contribute to web technologies. He co-founded Opera Software in
            1995 and served as its Chief Technology Officer until 2013. Today, he works at Google, focusing on improving
            web standards and performance.

            Wium Lie's work on CSS has had a profound impact on the web industry, shaping how we design and build
            websites today. His contribution to web technology continues to evolve as new features and improvements are
            added to CSS specifications.
        </p>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <p class="p8">
            JavaScript was initially called "Mocha" when Brendan Eich, a Netscape Communications programmer, created it
            in just ten days in May 1995. It was later renamed JavaScript, reportedly due to marketing reasons related
            to Sun Microsystems' Java platform.

            • The first version, JavaScript 1.0, was released in September 1995 as part of Netscape Navigator 2.0.

            • Initially, JavaScript was primarily used for client-side scripting, allowing dynamic interactions within
            web browsers without server-side processing.
        </p>

        <p class="p9">
            AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) revolutionized web development:

            • Jesse James Garrett coined the term "AJAX" in February 2005, describing techniques that allowed
            asynchronous communication between the browser and server.

            • This led to the rise of single-page applications (SPAs) and real-time updates, transforming the web
            experience.
        </p>

        <p class="p10">
            JavaScript's journey from a simple scripting language to a powerful, versatile tool for both front-end and
            back-end development is remarkable. Its adaptability and continuous improvement have cemented its place as a
            fundamental technology in modern web development.

            Throughout its history, JavaScript has faced challenges and criticisms, but its community-driven nature and
            constant innovation have ensured its relevance and importance in the ever-evolving world of web
            technologies.
